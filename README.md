- Database: Neon PostgreSQL

Keep this project fully isolated from any older live project:

- do not reuse the old database
- do not reuse the old backend
- do not reuse old environment variables
- do not reuse old Vercel or Render projects

- Shipments / Jobs
- Consolidation
- Customers
- Suppliers / Transporters
- Tariffs / Rate Master
- Documents

## Current Version

This build uses the live Render API and Neon PostgreSQL database for shipments, consolidations, customers, suppliers, tariffs, documents, invoices, additional charges, users, admin requests, settings, and audit data.

## Test Login

- User name: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`

## Render And Vercel

Render deploys the API from the root `render.yaml`.

Vercel deploys the static web console from `web/`.

Important: set `NEON_DATABASE_URL` in Render with the Neon pooled PostgreSQL connection string. Use the pooled Neon URL and keep `sslmode=require`.

Recommended GitHub deployment settings:

```text
Render Blueprint: use render.yaml from the repo root
Vercel Root Directory: web
Vercel Framework Preset: Other
Vercel Build Command: empty
Vercel Output Directory: .
```

Neon DB: set in Render as `NEON_DATABASE_URL`
```

The new backend is in `server/`, and the web console is in `web/`.

Database setup is now included:

- `server/sql/001_init.sql`
- `server/sql/002_seed.sql`
- `server/sql/003_views.sql`
- `npm run db:setup` from `server/`

It is prepared as a separate Node.js API service for Render with its own PostgreSQL connection and SQL starter schema.
